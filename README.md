This is an example of a schematic and PCB design project I did in Eagle software. It is a LED timer circuit. I desiged it following Jeremy Blum's youtube tutorials:
Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AXwjZoyNno, schematic design.
Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCTs0mNXY24, PCB layout.
Part 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oId-h6AeXXE, CAM files and design for manufacturing

The PDF file shows the schematic capture, the PCB design, and the layers of the PCB board.
